# K-means-Clustering-with-optimum-number-of-clusters
In the UCI Machine Learning data repository, there is a dataset called autompg. For that dataset choose only 5 variables, that is, Mileage, Displacement, Acceleration, Weight and Horsepower. Write a python program which will take a combination of two variables out of these 5 variables, runs a KMeans clustering on that subset and plot the scatterplot with color coding for clusters. For clustering, you need to decide the optimum number of clusters for each combination. The output will be a set of 10 scatter plots. Annotate the plots if you like.
