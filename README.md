# KMeans-Clustering-with-optimum-number-of-clusters
In the UCI Machine Learning data repository, there is a dataset called autompg. For that dataset 5 variables has been choosen, that is, Mileage, Displacement, Acceleration, Weight and Horsepower. The python program will take a combination of two variables out of these 5 variables, and then will run a KMeans clustering on that subset and will plot the scatterplot with color coding for clusters. For clustering, we need to decide the optimum number of clusters for each combination. The output will be a set of 10 scatter plots. 

DATA SOURCE :
This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition. "The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes." (Quinlan, 1993). Attribute Information:

mpg: continuous
cylinders: multi-valued discrete
displacement: continuous
horsepower: continuous
weight: continuous
acceleration: continuous
model year: multi-valued discrete
origin: multi-valued discrete
car name: string (unique for each instance)
